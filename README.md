## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual Image Sources**:
  - **Upload Your Photo**: Drag & drop or select an image file from your device to begin editing.
  - **Generate with AI**: Create entirely new, high-quality images from a simple text prompt. Describe your vision, choose an aspect ratio, and let the AI bring it to life.

- **Intuitive AI Editing Suite**:
  - **Prompt-Based Edits**: Modify your image by describing the changes you want in plain English. For example, "change the background to a beach at sunset" or "make the lighting more dramatic."
  - **Magic Erase**: Seamlessly remove unwanted objects, people, or imperfections by simply drawing over them.
  - **Inpainting**: Select an area of your image and tell the AI what to add or replace it with, from adding new objects to changing clothing.
  - **Extend Image (Outpainting)**: Expand the canvas of your photo in various aspect ratios. The AI intelligently generates new content to fill the empty space, matching the style of the original image.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - A clean, responsive, and modern UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
  - Instantly see your changes and compare them with the original image.
  - Download your final creation as a high-quality PNG file.
